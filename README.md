## 📋 Overview

Enterprise AI Copilot is a production-ready intelligent assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer business questions by:

- **SQL Agent**: Translates natural language to SQL queries for structured data
- **RAG Agent**: Retrieves information from document knowledge bases
- **Hybrid Agent**: Combines SQL and RAG results and synthesizes a comprehensive answer using LLM-powered synthesis logic

### Key Features

✨ **Intelligent Query Classification** - Automatically determines whether to use SQL, RAG, or both
🔒 **Enterprise Security** - Azure OpenAI integration with secure credential management
📊 **Comprehensive Logging** - Full execution traces with timing and source attribution
🐳 **Production-Ready** - Dockerized deployment with PostgreSQL backend
🎯 **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns for easy maintenance and testing
🧠 **LLM-Powered Synthesis** - Hybrid agent synthesizes answers from both SQL and RAG sources for richer responses

## Design decisions

### Query classification: LLM-based routing over a fixed classifier

The query router uses an LLM call with a structured prompt rather than a trained classifier. A fine-tuned classifier would perform better on known query patterns but fails silently on out-of-distribution inputs — it has no way to express uncertainty. The LLM router degrades more gracefully: when the query is genuinely ambiguous, it defaults to the hybrid path, which returns a superset of what either agent alone would produce. The cost is an extra ~0.5s on every request; the benefit is near-zero catastrophic misroutes on novel inputs.

### Hybrid agent: parallel retrieval with LLM synthesis

When the router selects hybrid mode, SQL and RAG retrieval run sequentially and their outputs are passed together to a synthesis prompt. An earlier design ran them in parallel but produced inconsistent answers when SQL results contradicted document context — the model had no reliable way to arbitrate. Sequential execution lets the SQL result anchor the factual ground truth, with RAG adding qualitative context on top. Latency increases by ~40% vs. single-agent paths; answer coherence improves substantially on questions that span both data sources.

### Vector store: FAISS over a managed service

FAISS was chosen over Azure Cognitive Search or Pinecone to keep the stack self-contained and deployable without external service dependencies. At the document volumes this system targets (<100k chunks), FAISS flat-index search is fast enough that the operational overhead of a managed service isn't justified. The tradeoff is that FAISS requires the index to fit in memory and doesn't support incremental updates without a rebuild — both acceptable constraints for a single-tenant enterprise deployment.

### Chunking strategy

Documents are chunked at 512 tokens with a 64-token overlap. The overlap was chosen empirically: too little and multi-sentence answers that straddle chunk boundaries degrade; too much and retrieval precision drops as chunks become redundant. Tables and structured content are pre-processed separately and injected as SQL rows rather than embedded as text, since embedding tabular data produces poor retrieval recall compared to direct SQL lookup.

### Observability: structured JSONL over metrics dashboards

Every agent execution writes a structured JSONL record including route taken, retrieval latency, token counts, and the full answer. This was deliberately kept as flat files rather than a metrics service — it makes the logs trivially inspectable during development (`jq`-friendly) and avoids coupling the deployment to an external observability stack. A production deployment would pipe these records to a log aggregator.

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Command Line

**SQL Query**
```bash
python3 -m src.agents.hybrid_agent -q "Who are our top 5 customers by revenue?"
```

**RAG Query**
```bash
python3 -m src.agents.hybrid_agent -q "What is our refund policy?"
```

**Hybrid Query**
```bash
python3 -m src.agents.hybrid_agent -q "List our VIP customers and explain their benefits"
```

### Python API

```python
from src.agents.hybrid_agent import execute_hybrid_query

result = execute_hybrid_query("How many transactions were completed last month?")
print(result['answer'])
print(f"Route taken: {result['route']}")
```

## 🔒 Security & Safety Notes


This project is designed for enterprise environments and follows best practices for credential management and data privacy. However, users should be aware of the following:

- **Read-Only Database Access:** The LLM agent operates using a read-only database account and cannot modify, insert, or delete data. This minimizes risk and ensures data integrity.
- **API Keys & Secrets:** Never commit your `.env` file or any secrets to version control. Use environment variables and secret managers in production.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure that sensitive business data is not exposed to external LLMs or third-party services unless explicitly permitted.
- **LLM Risks:** Generated answers may contain inaccuracies or hallucinations. Always validate critical outputs before acting on them.
- **Logging:** Logs may contain sensitive queries or results. Secure log files and rotate them regularly.

## 🚧 Weaknesses & Future Improvements

While Enterprise AI Copilot is production-ready, there are areas for future enhancement:

- **Fine-Grained Query Auditing:** Add more granular logging and monitoring for compliance and security.
- **Advanced Access Control:** Integrate with enterprise IAM solutions for user-level permissions.
- **Explainability:** Improve transparency of agent decisions and query routing.
- **UI Enhancements:** Add more visualization and admin controls to the Streamlit UI.
- **Testing & CI:** Expand test coverage and automate with GitHub Actions.
- **Scalability:** Optimize for distributed deployments and larger datasets.
